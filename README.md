## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced data analysis and visualization techniques using Power BI to transform raw sales data into meaningful business insights. The dashboard provides stakeholders with real-time visibility into sales performance, trends, and key metrics to drive data-driven decision making.

### 📚 Learning Approach
This project follows a **project-based learning methodology**, where I coded along with a comprehensive tutorial series. This hands-on approach allowed me to:
- Learn by doing rather than just theoretical concepts
- Build practical skills through real-world scenarios
- Work with actual MySQL database for hands-on SQL experience
- Understand the complete data analysis workflow from database to dashboard
- Practice data extraction, transformation, and visualization techniques
